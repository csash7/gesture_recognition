# Title: Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning

### Project Description
In this project, we integrate AI to a wearable device and make it smarter. Particularly, we will be working on gloves into which we integrate various sensors such as flex sensors and accelerometers. Using these sensors, we get info of our hand such as fingers position and wrist rotation. Based on the sensors data, we train an AI model and deploy it to recognize various gestures. Every gesture is mapped to an action and the action is triggered based on the gesture recognized.<br>
##### Some of the applications include:<br>
• PC and gaming: We can use these gloves as a wireless mouse and as a controller in VR gaming<br>
• Controlling drones: Based on the gestures, a drone’s altitude, speed can be controlled<br>
• Controlling a robotic hand: This application can be used in various fields to control a robotic hand such as controlling a robot with hand remotely where humans cannot reach<br>
• American Sign Language (ASL): It can be also used to identify gestures of physically challenged who use ASL to communicate with others<br>
• Home automation: Simple tasks such as switching on/off lights and other devices in a home can also be performed<br>
